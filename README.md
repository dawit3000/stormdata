Hello!

The best way to use the attached CSV file is to fork it first.Then click on it, click "Edit" using the pencil sign, then highlight, and cut and paste it in your EXCEL or Consol. The data is just in one column (two columns in one, separated by ";"). When you read it to your R,use sep=";" and  header=TRUE. You will get  48 by 2 dim dataframe. 
Sorry for the inconvenience, although it may be mainly GitHUB issue. The URL for reading/copying is:
